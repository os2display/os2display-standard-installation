- A valid dns name that points to the ip address of your server

### Installation - step 1 - Server components
Issue the commands below and the needed server components will be installed  

(You can copy and paste all commands - except sudo - in one copy past to a terminal - they will execute after each other)

```bash
sudo -s
rm -rf /var/setup.sh
wget -P /var https://raw.githubusercontent.com/os2display/os2display-standard-installation/main/scripts/setup.sh
